# Basics â€“ Beans and Containers
Simply put, beans are the java objects which form the backbone of a Spring application and are managed by Spring IoC container. Other than being managed by the container, there is nothing special about a bean (in all other respects it's one of many objects in the application).

The Spring container is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. The container gets its information on what objects to instantiate, configure, and manage by reading configuration metadata we define for the application.
